Hey welcome to the code base for my website. 

This is just something im making in my spare time to get familiar with base html, css and maybe typescript idk but mostly with web design.

Hoping to learn rust so i can use that instead of typescript tho since im kind of stubborn. No other reason tbh just that. Also i like that the rust logo is a gear and the mascot has
an adorable smile. So ya, maybe ill learn zig idk. But for now this is the website hope all is well.
